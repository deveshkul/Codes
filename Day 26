Given a number N, find the first N Fibonacci numbers. The first two number of the series are 1 and 1.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
Output: 1 1 2 3 5
Example 2:

Input:
N = 7
Output: 1 1 2 3 5 8 13
Your Task:
Your task is to complete printFibb() which takes single argument N and returns a list of first N Fibonacci numbers.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).
Note: This space is used to store and return the answer for printing purpose.

Constraints:
1<= N <=84



C++ Code-

class Solution
{
    public:
    //Function to return list containing first n fibonacci numbers.
    vector<long long> printFibb(int n) 
    {
        //code here
        vector<long long> res;
        long long x=1,y=1;
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            res.push_back(x);
            long long temp=x;
            x=y;
            y=x+temp;
        }
        return res;
        
        
    }
};
