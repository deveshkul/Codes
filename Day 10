Insert in Sorted way in a Sorted DLL
EasyAccuracy: 28.25%Submissions: 30K+Points: 2
Given a sorted doubly linked list and an element X, your need to insert the element X into correct position in the sorted DLL.

Note: The DLL is sorted in ascending order

Example:

Input:
LinkedList:

X = 9
Output:

Your Task:
You only need to complete the function sortedInsert() that takes head reference and x as arguments and returns the head of the modified list.The resulting DLL should be in ascending order. The printing and checking tasks are done by the driver code.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 <= Number of nodes <= 103




C++ Code-
Node* insertAtBegin(Node *head, int x) {
    Node *node = getNode(x);
    node->next = head;
    head->prev = node;
    return node;
}
Node* sortedInsert(Node * head, int x)
{
    Node *node = getNode(x);
    if(!head) return node;
    
    if(head->data > x) return insertAtBegin(head, x);
    
    Node *curr=head, *prev=NULL;
    while(curr && curr->data <= x) {
        prev = curr;
        curr = curr->next;
    }
    prev->next = node;
    node->prev = prev;
    node->next = curr;
    if(curr) curr->prev = node;
    
    return head;
};
